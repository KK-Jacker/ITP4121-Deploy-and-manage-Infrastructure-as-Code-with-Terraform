"We are a student group who studying for Higher Diploma in Cloud and Data "

"pandemic, we have a chance to collaborate with Microsoft to develop this "
"platform to help underprivileged students. \"iShare Donation Platform\" "
"initiated the donation of used computer devices to underprivileged "
"students. There were quite a lot of organisations that contributed to the"
" computer donation to the underprivileged students at this moment, but it"
" seems that many students were still missing computers for their online "
"studies. To tackle the current issue, we kicked off an initiative to "
"minimise the gap, making a donation of computer devices to "
"underprivileged students directly. The aims of our platform have the "
"following: 1) encourage the donor to donor used computer devices, 2) "
"help underprivileged students get suitable devices for their online "
"studies, and 3) help underprivileged students fix their technical "
"problem."
